[Flatpack](https://laravel-flatpack.com) makes building fully functional user interfaces for admin panels easier than ever: as easy as editing few lines of a YAML file. 

Besides providing a rich set of already built components and a solid stack to build a secure and intuitive experience for the users, it offers a fast and flexible solution for developers who want to have fun, try out new things and save precious time building up the an administration panels. 

Flatpack is a reactive full-stack app, built with [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/): [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/)

## Quick Install

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require flatpack/flatpack
```

Publish the config file and compiled assets:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="flatpack"
```

## Usage

Generating Flatpack composition files for `App\Models\Post` model...

```bash
php artisan make:flatpack Post
```

This command will create two files:

- A form template `/flatpack/posts/form.yaml`, that defines the layout composition of your posts form.
- A list template `/flatpack/posts/list.yaml`, that defines the layout composition of your posts table with pagination.

Let's check the result, visit `/backend/posts`.

Now start assembling, grab the generated files and define how they should look!

## Examples

- [Form example](#form)
- [List example](#list)

### Defining a form


```yaml
# /flatpack/posts/form.yaml

fields:
  name:
    label: Name
    type: text

  description:
    label: Description
    type: textarea

  created_at:
    label: Created
    type: datetime-picker

  updated_at:
    label: Updated
    type: datetime-picker
```

### Defining a list

```yaml
# /flatpack/posts/list.yaml

columns:
  id:
    label: ID
    sortable: true
    searchable: true

  name:
    label: Name
    sortable: true
    searchable: true

  created_at:
    label: Created
    type: datetime
    format: "Y-m-d H:i:s"
    sortable: true

  updated_at:
    label: Updated
    type: datetime
    format: "Y-m-d H:i:s"
    sortable: true
```

You can customise the yaml composition files by mapping your model's attributes, using components of differnt types and features: Data tables, text inputs, rich text editors, date pickers, tag pickers, searchable select menus, image upload, toggles and more.
