## Quick Install

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require flatpack/flatpack
```

Publish the config file and compiled assets:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="flatpack"
```

üí° To make sure that the public assets are always up-to-date, you should add this command to the `post-update-cmd` list in your `composer.json` file.


## Usage

Generating Flatpack composition files for `App\Models\Post` model...

```bash
php artisan make:flatpack Post
```

This command will create two files:

- A form template `/flatpack/posts/form.yaml`, that defines the layout composition of your posts form.
- A list template `/flatpack/posts/list.yaml`, that defines the layout composition of your posts table with pagination.

Let's check the result, visit `/backend/posts`.

Now start assembling, grab the generated files and define how they should look!

## Examples

Defining a form:

```yaml
title: Post
model: App\Models\Post
icon: book-open

toolbar:
  save:
    type: button
    label: Save
    action: save
    style: primary
    shortcut: s

main:
  title:
    label: Post Title
    placeholder: Your Post Title
    type: text

  body:
    type: block-editor

sidebar:
  created_at:
    label: Created
    type: datetime-picker

  updated_at:
    label: Updated
    type: datetime-picker
```

Defining a list:

```yaml
title: Post
model: App\Models\Post
icon: book-open

toolbar:
  create:
    label: New Post
    icon: plus
    link: create
    style: primary
    shortcut: enter

columns:
  id:
    label: ID
    sortable: true
    invisible: true

  title:
    label: Title
    sortable: true
    searchable: true

  created_at:
    label: Created
    type: datetime
    format: "Y-m-d H:i:s"
    sortable: true

  updated_at:
    label: Updated
    type: datetime
    format: "Y-m-d H:i:s"
    sortable: true
```

‚öôÔ∏è You can customise the yaml composition files by mapping your model's attributes, using components of differnt types and features: Data tables, text inputs, rich text editors, date pickers, tag pickers, searchable select menus, image upload, toggles and more.
